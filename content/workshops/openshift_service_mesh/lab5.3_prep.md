# Single Sign-On
Login, registration, and role-based authorization is handled via Red Hat SSO (aka Keycloak).
SSO is included as part of OpenShift or any middleware product subscription you have from Red Hat - woot!

## Installation
Because the service mesh will leverage SSO to authenticate users and generate JWT we need to install it. You will install it via Operator into your namespace.

### Customize the Resources
Check out the .yaml files here and customize for your cluster and domain (also you can customize other things like redirect urls, security settings, CORS, etc). Note that we have super relaxed security settings for the demo and they are not recommended to be used like this in production.

### Create an Instance of SSO / Configuration
You can do this CLI or webconsole. If using web console just use the + button at the top then drag'n'drop the file from the steps below.

Create Keycloak Instance
* oc apply -f ./keycloak.yaml

Note: your admin username is `admin` and the password is autogenerated. These are in a secret called: `credential-shared-keycloak`

We configure via Kubernetes resources to create the realm + roles + clients & users as follows:
* oc apply -f ./keycloak-realm.yaml
* oc apply -f ./keycloak-user-1.yaml
* oc apply -f ./keycloak-user-2.yaml


## Access Info / API documentation
