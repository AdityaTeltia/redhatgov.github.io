# Deploying a 3 Tier App

This builds on the work done in the labs so far to deploy a 3 Tier App. The reason for this lab are to highlight the capabilities of OpenShift to handle more complex application stacks and to show how Dynatrace automatically captures new applications and interactions between them.
